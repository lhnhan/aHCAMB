Recfast++ (v2.0, May 2018)

====================================================================================================
This directory contains the flexible cosmological recombination code Recfast++ (v1.2), 
originally written by Jens Chluba (Oct 2010++), with additions from Luke Hart and Boris Bolliet 
(The University of Manchester). This code originally started from the old C-version of Recfast 
by Seager et al. 1999 (this version can be found at https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~sasselov/rec/ 
although it is not maintained), but was then strongly rewritten and updated to:
 
- perform the normal Recfast computation (Recfast v1.4.2 with normal helium rec)
- include the recombination corrections of CosmoRec (Chluba & Thomas 2010). 
- allow running a simple Dark matter annihilation and decay module (Chluba, 2010, MNRAS, 402).
- include of primordial magnetic field heating (Chluba et al., 2015, MNRAS, 451, 2244)
- compute variations of fundamental constants (Hart & Chluba, 2017, 474, 1850-1861)

These tasks are achieved using the simple 3-level approach of Peebles and with appropriate 
correction function (Rubino-Martin et al, 2010, MNRAS, 403, 439-452). To solve the 
system of ODE's we use a simplified version of the stiff ODE-solver developed by 
Chluba, Vasil & Dursi, 2010. This solver allows us to avoid the switches present in the 
original Recfast-code and hugely increases the flexibility of the code.

Installation:

To compile the code follow these steps:

(i) in "Makefile" set "CC" to the C++ compiler that should be used (default g++)
(ii) type "make" to compile the code. This creates the executable: "Recfast++"

To clean up type "make clean" or "make tidy" (see makefile for difference)

====================================================================================================

====================================================================================================

Running the code:

The code is run by invoking

./Recfast++ runfiles/parameters.ini

The output of the code will be written in chosen path (default == './outputs/'). 
The filenames will depend on the chosen runmode.

The parameter files in ./runfiles contain the cosmological parameters and setting for 
the different runmodes, as well as explanations.
